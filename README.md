    1.Install Git: Before getting started, ensure that Git is installed on your system. You can download and install Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/

    2.Open a Project Folder in VS Code:

     -Open VS Code and navigate to the project folder you want to initialize as a Git repository.
     -If the folder isn't already open in VS Code, you can use the "File" menu to open it, or simply drag and drop the folder onto the VS Code window.

    3.Initialize a Git Repository:

    -Once the project folder is open in VS Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P or Cmd + Shift + P), and type "Git: Initialize Repository" and select it.
    -Alternatively, you can initialize a Git repository by clicking on the "Source Control" icon in the Activity Bar, then clicking on the "Initialize Repository" button and selecting the project folder.

    4.Stage and Commit Changes:

    -After initializing the repository, you'll see the files in your project listed in the Source Control view.
    -To stage changes, hover over the file you want to stage, and click on the "+" icon next to it. This stages the file for commit.
    -Once you've staged the changes you want to commit, enter a commit message in the text box at the top of the Source Control view and press Ctrl + Enter or click the checkmark icon to commit the changes.

    5.Push Changes to GitHub:
    -To push your changes to a remote repository on GitHub, first, make sure you have a GitHub account and have created a repository to push your changes to.
